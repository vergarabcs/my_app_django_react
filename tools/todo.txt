- I wasn't able to deploy to aws. My debit card is getting blocked for some reason. I decided I will try google cloud platform instead. I already started the 90 day 300$ free tier.

24
- I installed gcloud
- Credentials saved to file: [C:\Users\b.vergara\AppData\Roaming\gcloud\application_default_credentials.json]
- I installed postgres local. user: postgres, password: Cilantro6!
- I created postgres instance in cloud sql https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances/word-factory-db/overview?project=theta-moment-305721
- todo: setup postgres with django locally https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/how-use-postgresql-django

26
- postgres is setup locally. See pgadmin4. Migrations are also performed. local config has been applied.
- I cloned django sample app in /tools
- In progress: https://cloud.google.com/python/django/appengine#configuring_the_database_settings

27
- The settings.py the tutorial is talking about is the one in tools/python-docs-samples/run/django/mysite/settings.py
- I was able to deploy to heroku.

28
- I decided doing the backend first is easier.
