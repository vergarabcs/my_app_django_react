- I wasn't able to deploy to aws. My debit card is getting blocked for some reason. I decided I will try google cloud platform instead. I already started the 90 day 300$ free tier.

24
- I installed gcloud
- Credentials saved to file: [C:\Users\b.vergara\AppData\Roaming\gcloud\application_default_credentials.json]
- I installed postgres local. user: postgres, password: Cilantro6!
- I created postgres instance in cloud sql https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances/word-factory-db/overview?project=theta-moment-305721
- todo: setup postgres with django locally https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/how-use-postgresql-django

26
- postgres is setup locally. See pgadmin4. Migrations are also performed. local config has been applied.
- I cloned django sample app in /tools
- In progress: https://cloud.google.com/python/django/appengine#configuring_the_database_settings

27
- The settings.py the tutorial is talking about is the one in tools/python-docs-samples/run/django/mysite/settings.py
- I was able to deploy to heroku.

28
- I decided doing the backend first is easier.

15
- I setup channels. Currently getting an error while following https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/part_2.html

16
- I resolved my issue with get_asgi_application yesterday. The solution is to use channels.http.AsgiHandler instead.
- The tutorial made me run redis. I'm currently taking a crashcourse at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hbt56gFj998

18
- I downloaded docker and run redis with docker.
- docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:5
- I am now at https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/part_3.html

19
- I solved the exampleapp not running problem. It seems importing Provider and store is causing the problem because it worked when I removed those.

20
- I created a script that runs react and python. It also kills process running when exited.
- I will install drf. I am currently following drf tutorial.
- I installed pylance vs code plugin.

21
- I created game app.
